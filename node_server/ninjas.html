    <h1>Ninjas are awsome</h1>
    <p>
            Ninja was introduced from China based on the writings of 六韬 (six strategies) and 孙子兵法 (art of war) . The earliest Ninjia founders in Japan were Chinese migrants since the three kingdoms period. Their arrival brought the military theory of ninja( such as assassination, ambush, distraction, deception, spy) as well as many strange but practical weapons which eventually became what we know today about the way of Ninja. Their descendants set up some of the famous ninja clans later on in Japan such as 伊贺.
